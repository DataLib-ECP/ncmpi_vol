# Summary

This library is a prototype implementation of HDF5 VOL that uses PnetCDF for underlying I/O operation.
It enables applications to access the NetCDF formatted file using HDF5 API.
The VOL is currently under active development.

## Software Requirements
* HDF5
  + VOL is not yet in stable release at the time of the writing
    + Use develop branch to build the VOL
* PnetCDF
  + The VOL uses PnetCDF to handle I/O on NetCDF files
  + The VOL uses PnetCDF non-blocking API
    + Version 1.10 and later is recommended
* C++ compiler
  + Due to used of constant initializer, a C++ compiler is required
  + C++ 98 standard is suffice
+ Cmake utility
  + This library uses CMake to manage the build process

## Building Steps
* Build PnetCDF
  + Download PnetCDF
    + PnetCDF releases can be downloaded from https://parallel-netcdf.github.io/wiki/Download.html
    + Users can also get PnetCDF form official git repository at https://github.com/Parallel-NetCDF/PnetCDF.git
  + Run autoconfig if cloned from git repository
    + configure program is not included in git repository
  + Configure PnetCDF
    + Defualt paramemter is sufficent
  + Compile and install
  + Example
      ```
      ~$ git clone https://github.com/Parallel-NetCDF/PnetCDF.git
      ~$ cd pnetcdf
      ~/pnetcdf$ git checkout checkpoint.1.12.0
      ~/pnetcdf$ autoreconf -i
      ~/pnetcdf$ ./configure --prefix=${HOME}/PnetCDF
      ~/pnetcdf$ make
      ~/pnetcdf$ make install
      ```
* Build HDF5 with VOL support
  + Clone develop branch from HDF5 repository
    + HDF5 official git repository is at https://bitbucket.hdfgroup.org/scm/hdffv/hdf5.git
    + There is also a clone on git hub at https://github.com/live-clones/hdf5.git
  + Run autoconf
    + Use the autogen.sh script provided in the repository instead of "autoreconf command
  + Configure HDF5
    + Defualt paramemter is sufficent
  + Compile and install
  + Example
      ```
      ~$ git clone https://github.com/live-clones/hdf5.git -b developo
      ~$ cd hdf5
      ~/hdf5$ ./autogen
      ~/hdf5$ ./configure --prefix=${HOME}/hdf5_dev
      ~/hdf5$ make
      ~/hdf5$ make install
      ```
* Building the PnetCDF VOL library
  + Clone the PnetCDF VOL repository
  + Create a build directory
  + Run CMake to generate makefile
    + Run CMake in the build folder, set source directory to project directory
    + Set PNC_DIR to PnetCDF install path
    + Set H5_DIRt o HDF5 install path
  + Compile the library
    + make 
    + make install
      + set DESTDIR to install directory
  + Example
      ```
      ~$ git clone https://github.com/khou2020/ncmpi_vol.git
      ~$ cd ncmpi_vol
      ~/ncmpi_vol$ mkdir build
      ~/ncmpi_vol$ cd build
      ~/ncmpi_vol/build$ cmake .. -DPNC_DIR=${HOME}/PnetCDF -DH5_DIR=${HOME}/hdf5_dev
      ~/ncmpi_vol/build$ make
      ~/ncmpi_vol/build$ make install
      ```

## Usage
* Include library header
  + include "ncmpi_vol.h" in the source file that registers the PnetCDF VOL with HDF5
  + "ncmpi_vol.h" is located in the include directory under the install path
* Link library
  + link "libncmpi_vol.a"
  + "libncmpi_vol.a" is located in the lib directory under the install path
+ Use PnetCDF vol in application
  + Register PnetCDF VOL callback structure using H5VLregister_connector
    + Callback structure is call "H5VL_ncmpi_g"
  + Set PnetCDF in file creation property list to use PnetCDF VOL
  + See example program /examples/create_open.c

## Developer Note
* Limitation
  + Memory space selection is not supported
    + H5S_SEL_ALL is assumed
  + Different semantic to HDF5 API on H5DWrite and H5DRead
    + H5DWrite and H5DRead only schedule the I/O operation but does not perform them
    + H5Fflush must be called to complete the actual I/O operation
    + Before calling H5Fflush, the buffer passed to H5DWrite and H5DRead cannot be used
  + All metadata operation must be called collectively
    + all_coll_metadata_ops must be set in file access property list
    + coll_metadata_write must be set in file access property list
* Future work
  + Support memory space selections
